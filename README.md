# DigiExam-Handle-Protection
Since DigiExams lockdown mode closes down process with TerminateProcess i thought it would be good to bypass it.
It has a bug that you can't open a process that wants elivated process when the driver is loaded. 
I do not know if DigiExam checks for this. But for example protect explorer.exe and you can have noted on your 2 monitor.
